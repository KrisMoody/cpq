# Proposal: Add Interactive Schema Diagram

## Summary
Replace the static Prisma ERD SVG with an interactive, zoomable, and draggable database schema diagram using Vue Flow. Users can explore the data model by panning, zooming, and clicking on entities to see field details.

## Motivation
The current `PrismaERD.vue` component displays a static SVG generated by `prisma-erd-generator`. While informative, it lacks interactivity:
- Cannot zoom in on specific areas of the complex schema
- Cannot rearrange entities to focus on relationships of interest
- No way to see field details without squinting at small text
- Large schemas become overwhelming without navigation aids

Vue Flow provides a Vue 3-native solution with built-in zoom/pan, draggable nodes, minimap navigation, and custom node components.

## Scope
- Replace `PrismaERD.vue` with a Vue Flow-based interactive diagram
- Parse the Prisma schema to extract entities, fields, and relationships
- Create custom node components styled as database tables
- Add zoom/pan controls and optional minimap
- Support click-to-expand for viewing field details

## Out of Scope
- Editing the schema from the UI
- Persisting layout changes
- Generating migration scripts
- Replacing the simpler `EntityDiagram.vue` (the overview diagram)

## Dependencies
- `@vue-flow/core` - Core library
- `@vue-flow/background` - Optional background pattern
- `@vue-flow/controls` - Zoom controls
- `@vue-flow/minimap` - Navigation minimap

## Spec Deltas
- `learning-ui`: Modified requirements for Database Schema visualization
