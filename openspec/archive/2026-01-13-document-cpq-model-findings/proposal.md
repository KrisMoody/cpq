# Change: Document CPQ Product Model Findings

## Why
During product model discussions, key architectural decisions and concepts were clarified regarding how bundles, options, and attributes relate in a CPQ context. These findings should be captured as reference documentation to guide future development decisions.

## What Changes
- Add design documentation capturing CPQ product model concepts
- Document the distinction between attributes, options, and bundles
- Document pricing resolution strategies for options
- No code or spec changes - documentation only

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (documentation only)
- Affected code: None
- Deliverable: `design.md` as reference documentation for the team
